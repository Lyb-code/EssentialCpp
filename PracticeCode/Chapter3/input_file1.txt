fUML is a subset of the standard Unified Modeling Language (UML) for which there are standard, precise execution semantics. This subset includes the typical structural modeling constructs of UML, such as classes, associations, data types and enumerations. But it also includes the ability to model behavior using UML activities, which are composed from a rich set of primitive actions. A model constructed in fUML is therefore executable in exactly the same sense as a program in a traditional programming language, but it is written with the level of abstraction and richness of expression of a modeling language.
Like UML, fUML is standardized by the Object Management Group (OMG), which maintains the fUML specification (which is formally known as the "Semantics of a Foundational Subset for Executable UML Models"). There is also a standard textual surface syntax for fUML call the Action Language for fUML (Alf), which is particularly useful for defining detailed behaviors in the context of an fUML model, and which has its own reference implementation.
